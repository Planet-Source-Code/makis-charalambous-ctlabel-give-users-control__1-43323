### Description

This control allows your users to change the label captions of your fields at run time. I think this is a unique aproach and concept to customized legends. A lot of my customers sometimes don't agree with the captions I use on certain forms (nitty gritty:) so I sat down one afternoon and cooked this activex. Is not very commented but the code is very simple and easy to follow. This is a quicky control, and if you like it then I will try and improve it. This is the very first time I upload a code to planet source and any comments will be highly appreciated and motivate me for more uploads. Thanks !!
 
### More Info
 
This code uses a connection to a database through ADO, but it is very simple and only basic visual basic programming is needed.
